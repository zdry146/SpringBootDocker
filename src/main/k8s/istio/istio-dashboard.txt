Access the Kiali dashboard.

$ istioctl dashboard kiali

In the left navigation menu, select Graph and in the Namespace drop down, select default.

To see trace data, you must send requests to your service. The number of requests depends on Istioâ€™s sampling rate and can be configured using the Telemetry API. With the default sampling rate of 1%, you need to send at least 100 requests before the first trace is visible. To send a 100 requests to the productpage service, use the following command:

$ for i in $(seq 1 100); do curl -s -o /dev/null "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"; done
